Android and Kotlin learning project I did in 2019 for a university class seminar. It's a Twitch chat app with FrankerFaceZ and BetterTTV emote support integrated. Project was super rushed so there are bad practices and anti-patterns all over the code.
#
Due to changes in twitch and Bttv API which happened since then, emotes don't work in anonymous mode and Bttv emotes won't download.
